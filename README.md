# Witcher-3-Enhanced-Edition-Simplified
A small project aiming at removing some of EEs integrated mods

As a disclaimer this mod is for EE REDUX (v1.31d) and not normal EE

Enhanced Edition is an excellent overhaul mod however it does suffer from some issues, one of those being its integrated mods.
On top of causing compatability issues with other mods, some like Friendly HUD are outdated versions of the original mod meaning fixes and improvements were not brought in

As such I have taken the task of removing some of these mods in order to hopefully create an easier modding experience

The removed mods are currently:

Friendly HUD

Immersive Camera

More Quick Slots and Quick Inventory



Installation

I recommend before installing this going into your mod menu, going to the addons section and selecting the "Vanilla" preset for all of Friendly HUDs settings as well as Immersive Cams and More Quick Slots'

Remove the original file "modW3EE" from your mod directory. Then download this mod and place it in your mod directory effectively replacing it. Also navigate to documents/The Witcher 3 and replace the input.settings file with the one from the mod

You will also need to remove the following xml files from bin/config/r4game/user_config_matrix/pc

modFHUDConfig.xml

ImmCamMenu.xml

modMoreQuickSlots.xml



If there are issues with the mod then do let me know so I can rectify them
